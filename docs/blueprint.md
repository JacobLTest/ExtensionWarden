# **App Name**: Extension Warden

## Core Features:

- Extension Catalog: Display a list of available extensions and their details.
- Admin Panel: Implement an admin panel to manage the extension allow-list. The panel must have features to add, remove and list allow-listed extensions. Start with only 'ms-python.python' as allowed.
- Allow-list Indicator: Visually indicate which extensions are on the allow-list.
- Extension Suggestion: AI-powered tool that assists admins in discovering reputable extensions based on project type. Suggest extensions with high community adoption that enhance code quality, security, and development speed, when provided with a description of the current project.
- Code Editor and Debugger: Provide a code editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging capabilities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) to convey security and professionalism.
- Background color: Dark gray (#34495E), providing a comfortable contrast for extended use.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3498DB), used sparingly for interactive elements and important alerts.
- Clean, monospaced font to emphasize the code focused context.
- Simple and clear icons for extension categories and actions.
- A hierarchical layout, focusing on clear presentation of extensions.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for adding or removing extensions from the allow-list.
